# image grid - bearblog-plugin

A very much in development attempt of mine to make myself use bearblog for a photography portfolio by making it easier to mass display images in a nicely spaced grid. 

<hr>

## How does it work? (currently)
I just store all of the images I want displayed in a github repostiroy and then ping the github api for urls to each image. Try to sort that and space things nicely in the grid so we don't have just gaps between things of different aspect ratios and then just inject that html into the web page with the built in lazy loading so it doesnt freeze.

## Why use bearblog and not litteraly anything else?
Because I can, and I already pay for it.
